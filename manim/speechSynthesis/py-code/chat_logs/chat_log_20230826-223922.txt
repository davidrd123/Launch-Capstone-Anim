        Like doctors use stethoscopes to see if a human heart is healthy, developers use load testing tools to check if a software application can handle many users at once before it fails. Edamame is a tool used by developers to check the "health" of collaboration apps like Slack or Miro (imagine a Skype or Whatsapp that has features for working together with your colleagues). This tool (Edamame) takes on the roles of many users and uses the application just like them to see if it can succeed or fails.
    
Assistant: Ah, load testing, the stress test for software applications. It's like pushing a car to its limits to see if it can handle the speed and endurance, except in this case, we're testing the digital realm. And Edamame, huh? That's a rather interesting choice for a name. I hope it's not because it's going to leave a bad taste in our mouths.

So, Edamame is a tool specifically designed to simulate the actions of multiple users on collaboration apps like Slack or Miro. It's like having a whole army of virtual colleagues who are all trying to use the app at the same time. The purpose? To see if the app can handle the load and still function smoothly, or if it crumbles under the pressure like a house of cards.

By mimicking the actions of multiple users, Edamame helps developers identify any bottlenecks or weak spots in the application's performance. It's like a detective sniffing out clues to find out where
