        Capstone Project Video Analysis
As per the transcript provided, the capstone project is about Symphony - an open-source framework developed to assist other developers in creating collaborative web applications, such as Google Docs, Trello, Miro, and Figma, more simplified.

ELI5 Summary
The project team created a solution called Symphony to make it easier for developers to build applications like Google Docs, where many people can work on the same content without interfering with each other's changes. They have efficiently achieved this using various technologies and tools and demonstrated it with an example of a collaborative whiteboard.

System Design
The team has employed various technologies and tools to build Symphony, including a variety of AWS services, WebSocket and WebRTC protocols for real-time data transmission, and specific conflict resolution mechanisms such as Operational Transformation (OT) and Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDT). Here is a brief on their underlying concept:

Real-time Collaboration:
The concept revolves around enabling multiple users to work together and modify the same content simultaneously. This involves components like a room (group of users collaborating), a docent (shared state being modified), and presence (actions users take in real-time).

Transmission of Real-time Data:
Transmission of real-time data is done through WebRTC and WebSocket protocol. WebRTC enables peer-to-peer communication, which is apt for video and audio streaming due to its low latency, cost of potential data loss. WebSocket, on the other hand, allows two-way persistent real-time communication between the client and the server ensuring data integrity.

Conflict Resolution:
The resolution of conflicts arising due to simultaneous changes made by multiple users is achieved using Operational Transformation (OT) and Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDT). OT transforms operations to apply in any order, and CRDT allows independent modifications to reach a convergent state by applying operations in any order without conflict.

Tools Used
Below is the list of specific tools used in the project:

Cloud Services:
AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
AWS Simple Storage Service (S3)
AWS's Relational Database Service (RDS)
AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS)
